2) square_openloop.py: Make the Turtle move in a square of 2x2 units with 0.2 linear velocity
and 0.2 rad/s angular velocity.

3)  square_closedloop.py: Make the Turtle move in a square of 3x3 with velocity control. Predefine
the coordinate points of the square in the program. Make the turtle move from   
(5,5) -> (8,5) -> (8,8) -> (5,8) -> (5,5).
